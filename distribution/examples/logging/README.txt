LOG INTERCEPTOR

Using the LogInterceptor, Membrane Monitor and Service Proxy can log requests and responses.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

In this example we will visit a web site and take a look at the logs in the console. 

To run the example execute the following steps:

1. Go to the examples/logging directory.

2. Execute service-proxy.bat

3. Open the URL http://localhost:2000/ in your browser.

4. Take a look at the output of the console.


Troubleshooting:

If Membrane does not generate any ouput after loading an URL, it is possible that your browser has already cached the ressource. 

Shortcuts for the different browsers:

Safari: ALT + click reload or CMD + SHIFT + R while using a mac
Firefox: SHIFT + click reload
Chrome: SHIFT + F5 or CONTROL + F5
IE: CONTROL + F5
