GROOVY INTERCEPTOR

With the GroovyInterceptor you can run groovy scripts to manipulate or monitor messages.



RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

In this example we will use the GroovyInterceptor to add a header to the request and to print all headers of the response to the console.

Execute the following steps:

1. Execute examples/groovy/service-proxy.bat

2. Open the URL http://localhost:2000 in your browser.

3. Take a look at the output of the console where Membrane Service Proxy is running.


TROUBLESHOOTING

If your console does not generate any Output, make sure your browser did not load the URL from Cache. Also have a look at the FAQ-Section https://github.com/membrane/service-proxy/wiki/Membrane-Service-Proxy-FAQ
